# No Rate Limiting on Form which Triggers Emails

## Overview of the Vulnerability

Rate Limiting prevents an application from becoming unresponsive or unavailable due to too many requests exhausting the application's resources. A lack of rate limiting on an email triggering endpoint was identified. This allows an attacker to create a large amount of emails to any email address, which they could use to spam a target with emails.

## Business Impact

No rate limiting on a form which triggers email can result in reputational damage for the business as customersâ€™ trust is impacted through receiving large amounts of unwanted and unsolicited emails. This also creates the risk of the email address domain being added to a spam list.

Additionally, for systems that use Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) email providers, there can be direct financial costs associated with sending large volumes of email.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Enable a HTTP intercept proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP, to record and intercept web traffic from your browser
1. Using a browser, sign into the application
1. Navigate to {{url}} and fill out the form that triggers an email, using an email that you own as the destination
1. Submit the form while using the HTTP intercept proxy to intercept the request
1. Using the HTTP intercept proxy, re-issue the captured request 400 times in rapid succession
1. Observe within the target email address inbox that all 400 of these requests triggered an email, showing that there is no rate-limiting on the form
